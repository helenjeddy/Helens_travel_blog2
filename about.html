    <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
    <p>We chose a hotel on the outskirts of the city, a short walk from the tram stop.
        It was a 20 min ride on the tram into the city and the trams run every 7-10 mins,
         depending on the time of day. <br><br>
        On our first trip into the city, we caught the Hop-on-Hop-off bus to get the lay of the land.<br><br>

        We then spent the next 3 days exploring the city.  
        Sights included: The Royal Mile, The Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh Castle, The Royal Yacht Britannia and Royal Botanic Gradens. <br> <br>
    </p>
        <p class="specific-paragraph">
        Tip 1:   It is much cheaper to stay on the outskirts of the city than in the city - Just
        make it close to the public transport <br>
        Tip 2:  Use a hop-on-hop-off bus to get an overview of a city when you first arrive. <br>

    <h2>Day Trips from Edinburgh</h2>
    <p>We followed our days in Edinburgh with some day trips around the area.<br><br>
    Day 1: Culzean Castle - a great National Trust site with spectacular scenery which is about 1 & 3/4 hours drive.
     The castle sits on a cliff edge and has extensive gardens.
     <br><br>
    Day 2: Rosslyn Chapel - featured in the movie "The Da Vinci Code", about 30 min drive. 
    It is a 15th century chapel with ornate stone carvings and mysterious symbolism. 
    Rosslyn Chapel is a lovely example of Gothic architecture.
     <br><br>
    Day 3: Glascow - about an hour in the car or you could take a train. 
    Glascow is a Port city situated on the river Clyde, with the largest
     population in Scotland.
    <br><br>
    Day 4: St Andrews - is a seaside town, on Scotland's east coast. It is the home to 
    St Andrew's Golf Club - about a one hour drive. 
    This is one of the oldest Golf Clubs in the world, being founded in 1843. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="specific-paragraph">
    Tip 3: Join the National Trust in Australia before you travel.
    It is cheaper than joining overseas national trusts and as it holds reciprocal rights with most other countries, 
    it means you can visit as many National Trust sites as you wish, free of charge.<br><br>

    <h2>Highlands</h2>
    <p>For our second week in Scotland, we were based in the Cairngorms National park, 
    at Craigendarroch.<br>
    The local village was Ballater- a very prety little spot.<br>

    For our first day trip in this area we chose to make our longest trip.  We had booked a trip 
    on the Jacobite train, based in Fort William, at the end of our week.<br>
    We wanted to check out where the train station was and how long it would take to get there, 
    so we wouldn't miss the train. <br><br>
    We left early and passed through lots of quaint little towns, arriving at Fort William about 12.30pm. 
    We had a walk around to find the train station and where we should park. <br><br>
    We drove from there up to Inverness via Loch Ness.  All day we had beautiful scenery about us with Loch's, heather 
    and soaring mountains. <br><br>
    We had showers happening on and off so decided then to drive on to the 
    far North West coast to a little town called, Ullapool. It was a beautiful little town, 
    with a small harbour and a ferry docking at the time we arrived. <br><br>
    There was lovely terrain with hills of heather and rainstorms coming in off the Atlantic.
     <br><br>
     We travelled the next day towards Aberdeen.
     A brief stop at the beach, that looks into the North Sea, with a number of ships at anchor, 
     then off to the Pittmedden Gardens.<br><br>
     A lovely place with lots of different plants, hedges, fruit 
     trees and herbs all wrapped up in a National Trust property.<br>
     Our next stop was Fyvie Castle. A grand old place, steeped in lots of history. 
     The inside was very interesting with a wide stone circular staircase and lots of small rooms 
     in the turrets - one was a 'murder room' where the wife was apparently locked in and starved to death, 
     but she came back and haunted the Duke when he had quickly married his next wife. <br><br>
  
    We set out again the next say to visit a few sites. 
    We started the day by driving to Falkland and spent an enjoyable couple of hours at the Falkland Palace. 
    The gardens were beautiful and included the first tennis court built 450 years ago. <br><br>
    The inside of the Palace was very interesting and there were guides in each section to explain the 
    history of all the paintings, furniture and rooms.<br><br>
    We passed by Balmoral Castle on the way home, and as the Queen was currently on holidays there, 
    we decided to call in and say hi! Only got as far as the front gate.

    <h2>Culloden, Jacobite Train and Isle of Skye</h2>
    <p>A day trip to Inverness included a stop at Culloden.  
    It was strange to walk over the ground where some of our ancestors fought and died. <br><br>
    The next day was a complete change. We had a lovely day out on the Jacobite Train.  
     Departing from Fort William and arriving at Mallaig, 
     a port town on the west coast of Scotland. It was about a 2 hour trip. The scenery included 
     the Glenfinnan Viaduct, which is featured on the journey to Hogwarts in Harry Potter.
    We then had about an hour and half layover to look around and enjoy a fish and chip lunch. 
    Then it was back on the train for the journey home.<br><br>
    The following day was our last in Scotland.
    We drove to the Isle of Skye with its picturesque villages and amazing landscapes. <br>
    We then enjoyed the drive down the west coast and back into England, 
    passing on the way scenery from the movies "Skyfall" and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="specific-paragraph">
    Tip 4:   If you want to go on The Jacobite Steam Train, be aware it only runs from 
        early April to late October and you will need to book early.<br>

    <h2>A note about Roads</h2>
    <p>Just a word about the roads we travelled on. <br>
        Some are one lane and you hope you don't meet anyone; some are wide enough for 2 cars.....just. <br>
        We got excited when we had a road that had a white line down the middle, as it was a more comfortable fit.<br>
        Some roads through towns have footpaths and then 2 story houses right up to the footpaths and, 
        as there is no nature strip, it feels really close. <br>
        Some roads in the country have canopies of trees making them seem like a green tunnel.<br>
        As we stayed in the mountains we often travelled through a ski resort area, with heaps of tows up the hill. <br>
        The roads into and out of these areas are like being on a roller coaster - 
        our grandkids would love it with dips and rises, steep drops into curves - it is quite fun!!!</p>
